## Description
This application is a website that contractors can use to post and apply for construction jobs based on qualifications, needs, and disciplines. We created this application to make it fast and easy for contractors to get the help they need to complete their job. Users will be able to post, delete, and edit job listings, view recent listings, apply for listings, and search job listings. 
Challenges we faced were creating the databases, making the website interactive, pushing and merging branches without conflicts, and putting to use the knowledge of front-end and back-end coding.

The tech we used to create this application are: 
Node.js
Express.js
MySql
Handlebars
Heroku (for deployment)

## Instilation and Use
Users should be able to make or create an account on Build-Link which will then give them access to create or apply of job listings. To view the backend, you can clone the repo down to you local machine and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies and packages to run the application.

Work breakdown: 
Backend files (config, controllers, db, models, seeds, utils) - Sarah and Juan

However, the group worked on all parts of the project multiple times throughout the course of the assignment.
